# Project background
SDU is leading a reserach project called WildDrone - Research in Autonomous Drones for Nature Conservation. The project focuses has two wildlife reserves, the Wadden Sea National Park in Denmark and the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. One of the ideas that has come out of this project, especially for our work in Kenya, is to develop a next generation wildlife camera. In this project you will build the embedded linux setup for such a wildlife camera. You are welcome to read more about the project at this website, however this is not directly relevant to the project: https://wilddrone.eu

# Project 
In the EMLI 2024 project you will build the embedded linux setup for a next generation wildlife camera system:

_A camera that takes pictures based on different triggers; that does not need connection to the internet but instead offloads the pictures to a drone that periodically fly across the wildlife park andcircles for a short while at each camera; and performs AI based automatic annotation of the pictures._

The team should:
1. Design and develop a wildlife camera system that fullfills all or as many as possible of the functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.
2. Prepare the team document, the team video and the team git repository according to the description of the individual presentation portfolio.

Individually: 
1. Prepare the individual document according to the description of the individual presentation portfolio.
2. Submit the individual presentation portfolio describing the project in accordance with the listed requirements of the individual presentation portfolio.
